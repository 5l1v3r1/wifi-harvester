For collecting probed SSID name by wireless devices, Access point detail and connected clients.

NOTE : I have not written the script for the above mentioned yet... but attached Probing.sh is written years back using bash script which will display probing devices detail.

To run the script, do the following

1) Download "Probing.sh"

2) Create "~/SYWorks/" directory on your system

3) Copy "Probing.sh" to "/SYWorks/" directory

4) Download "mac-oui.db"

5) Create "~/SYWorks/Database" directory

6) Copy "mac-oui.db" to "~/SYWorks/Database" 

7) Enable a monitor device by using "airmon-ng"

8) Run using "bash Probing.sh" in Kali Linux or "sh Probing.sh" in Backtrack..
